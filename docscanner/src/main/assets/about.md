About Open Note Scanner
=======================

**Â© 20XX [Claudemir Todo Bom](http://todobom.com)**

This application provides a quick way to scan and store hand written notes and arts, and also shopping receipts and other documents. It also supports automatic capture of images on a [pre-formatted page](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/raw/master/Page%20Templates/A4%20with%202%20pages.pdf).

Making Android applications is not my main job, I made this application out of curiosity and because there are dozens of apps with similar objectives but none of them is open source.

If you think that this application or any of my contributions is worth some money and you are willing to pay for it, please feel free to make any donation through Paypal, Bitcoin or Dogecoin.
